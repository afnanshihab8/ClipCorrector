This is the task for the internship application by CuriousPM where applicants were requested to build a PoC in Python using Streamlit shich takes a video file and replaces its
audio with AI generated text. 

Developments I would have added to this if I had the time and resources:
1. Better UI/UX
2. Obviously, better sync between the audio and video.
